# IsNSFW - The URL Shortener for NSFW Content

This project is really just way for me to experiment with various technologies. Key points:

  * .NET Core 2.0
  * ServiceStack Templates
  * CQRS / CQS
  * Decorators
  * Better Unit Tests (I usually skip straight to Integration tests because they're the most critical)

## But... why?
A few (many) years back, I launched isNSFW.com. Because of a mishap with a hosting provide, the project
got deleted from their servers, and I never bothered setting it back up. I had the source code, but not
the data, and didn't feel like building. Now, since it's a simple, small project, I'm reviving it.
